Quebec Fluffy Omelette recipe 
(Adapted by Jesse Rhodes from Alexandre Gauthier, who learned it from someone in his family) 

An unconventional omelette with toasted cheese, finished on the broiler. 

I find the 2 egg version is enough for 1 person. The method is the same, just use a larger pan if you are using 4 eggs. And the ingredient amounts are very forgiving, as you'll still get a delicious breakfast even if you have too much or too little of something. :) 

Ingredients: 

- 2-4 eggs
- Olive oil or vegetable oil
- Milk or water
- Small chopped filling (sausage crumble, onions, diced peppers, etc)
- Large sliced filling (mushrooms, sliced peppers, sausage slices, bacon, spinach, etc)
- Any cheese that melts well 
- Salt 
- Salsa or hot sauce or black pepper (optional)

Instructions: 

1. Preheat a good non-stick pan on medium-low heat. For 2 eggs, I use a small 8" pan; for 4 eggs, I use a 10" pan. Add a drop of olive oil to the pan. 

2. Break the eggs into a bowl. Add a small amount of milk or water, about 1/2 Tbsp per egg. Mix the eggs and milk well, with a high vertical axis, creating plenty of bubbles. Add a pinch of salt and your small chopped filling, and mix the eggs some more. 

3. Move an oven rack to the top position, and preheat the broiler on high. 

4. Check the pan - when the oil is nice and warm, and easy to fling around quickly by shaking the pan, it's at the right temperature. Give the egg mixture one more quick mix and then dump it all into the pan at once. 

5. As the egg mixture slowly cooks, the pool of uncooked egg on the top will gradually get smaller. Once it's about 1/2" away from the edges of the pan, turn off the stovetop and add the cheese and larger toppings, just like decorating a pizza. 

6. Move the pan to the broiler. Be careful to leave the pan handle sticking out of the oven, as it might melt if it's under the broiler, and either way you will need to grab it in a few minutes. 

7. When the cheese is toasted and the omelette has risen in the pan, remove the pan from the oven and slide the omelette onto a plate, folding over if you want. If you're really slick, you can fold it over with the pan mid-slide. Add salsa or hot sauce or some fresh black pepper, and enjoy!
