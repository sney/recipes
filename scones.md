Rosemary Cheddar sourdough scones  
Yield: 9-12 scones 

Prep time: 30 minutes  
Bake time: 20 minutes

Ingredients:

- 315g all purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 56g granulated sugar 
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 84g cold unsalted butter, cut into small chunks (To use cannabutter, see notes at the end.)
- 1/2 cup buttermilk, plus extra for brushing 
- 1/2 cup sourdough discard, at least 24 hours after feeding 
- 1 egg
- 2 sprigs' worth of fresh rosemary
- 100g old cheddar or other strong-flavored cheese, finely grated.

Instructions: 

1. Preheat oven to 375 F, with rack in the middle. Butter a cookie sheet, or line with parchment paper. 
2. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Add the butter chunks, and mix until the butter bits are no bigger than 5mm. If using cannabutter, this may take a while. 
3. In a small bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, sourdough discard, and egg. Add the resulting mixture to the dry ingredients all at once. 
4. Add around half of the cheese and the rosemary, and mix until it starts to form a dough ball. Some loose flour will remain at the bottom of the bowl. 
5. Turn the dough onto a well floured counter and knead by hand until the flour is all incorporated and the dough feels consistent and not too sticky. 
6. Roll or hand-stretch the dough out flat, around 20mm thick. You do not have to be exact. 
7. Use a cookie cutter, or the top of a drinking glass, to cut scones from the dough. Place the scones on the cookie sheet about 25mm apart, roll up the scraps, and repeat until all the dough is used. 
8. Brush the tops of the scones with buttermilk, and top with the remaining cheese.
9. Bake for about 20 minutes, checking for doneness after 15. Ovens may vary. Your scones are done when the tops are well browned, and the scones easily slide off the pan. 

Serve warm. Scones can be frozen and reheated later.

Cannabutter notes: I had good results with an approximately 4:1 ratio of conventional butter to cannabutter. Here, that would be about 17g of cannabutter, mixed with 67g of conventional unsalted. Melt the two butters together and mix well, then refrigerate until solid. With these amounts, the cannabis flavor was undetectable and the strength felt like about 8-10mg each.
